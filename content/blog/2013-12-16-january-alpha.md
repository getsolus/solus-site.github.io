Hello all, a quick update to any who may be following the blog.

Given the time of year, with Christmas literally around the corner, the first alpha won't be hitting until some time in January. To most this was probably a given, but its best to clarify the plans.

In the mean time, I'll be preparing the Evolve OS repository with some reconfigured packages, and continue working on the Budgie Desktop. In light of recent news on various blogs, I feel I should clarify some points:

* Evolve OS is not a fork. It is a direct derivative of openSUSE 13.1
* Budgie Desktop is also not a fork. It is a set of components based on existing GNOME and GTK technology/libraries. Also note it is not GNOME Shell itself, but a custom session, panel and Mutter wrapper to control the Budgie Desktop
* The project is nowhere near ready for public use, we just launched! 🙂 The blog is kept active so that interested users can track project progress.

If you're interested in checking out any parts of Evolve OS, you should check the following links of interest:

* [Budgie Desktop git repository](https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop)
* [Base System git repository](https://github.com/solus-project/base-system)

Please do not expect daily updates at this point, remember its the last week before most of us take our vacation, and then Christmas itself. Busy times! If I do not speak to you all again before Christmas itself,  I hope you all enjoy the holiday season, and look forward to talking again once we've all returned, a few pounds heavier, in the new year.
