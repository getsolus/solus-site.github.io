Some people may now be wondering what we intend to use as the desktop environment in Evolve OS. If you've followed my recent Google+ posts, you may already know about the Budgie Desktop.

Budgie Desktop integrates with the GNOME stack, providing a powerful yet traditional desktop using modern techniques and technology. With a panel down the bottom of the screen, and a menu reminiscent of 
Cardapio, most users will feel at home instantly with the desktop.

The core components are as follows:

- **budgie-wm**: This is a simple wrapper around libmutter, which is used by GNOME Shell. We use it to manage our windows, customize animations and provide a wallpaper of your choice.
- **budgie-panel**: A traditional panel that currently sits at the bottom of the screen. Future versions will enable users to use 3rd party plugins to extend their panel experience to suit their needs.
- **budgie-session**: Simply bootstraps the components of the desktop to get you working straight away. Does nothing more than launch gnome-settings-daemon, the window manager and the panel.

If you're interested in checking out the code (which is written in C), please [check out the GitHub page](https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop)
