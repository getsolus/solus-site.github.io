Very short post, because I'm very busy working on the code for this 🙂

Note, **this code is not yet on GitHub**, but will find its way there in the next few days. As anyone looking can tell, I've drawn heavy inspiration from Chrome OS for the 
initial direction of the desktop.

This will be used within the first ISO's that I release, and after feedback is received we can look at optimizing and improving the experience.

Note that the second screenshot was from conceptual stage, and you can see GNOME's context menu on the background. The most likely approach for the Evolve OS desktop 
will be to go the full mile with a Flat UI theme.
