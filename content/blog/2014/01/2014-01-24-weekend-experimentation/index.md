Hello all!

As some of you may know from my recent G+ post, I recently had to perform some maintenance on the Evolve OS server after a bout of attacks. You'll be pleased to
 know nothing was compromised, and we suffered no data loss.

This weekend will be constructively used to begin the Evolve OS experimentation. This will mean work on Budgie Desktop, and Budgie Media Player will resume this 
weekend. Any feedback, ideas and comments at this stage are highly appreciated! If enough feedback is received in the next couple of days, we can begin new spins this 
weekend for some initial ISO's.
