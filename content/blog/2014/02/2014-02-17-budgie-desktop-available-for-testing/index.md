To further facilitate the development of Evolve OS, I reach out across the interwebz and ask you, the curious, to give Budgie Desktop a spin.

For openSUSE 13.1, and Fedora 20, [please install via OBS](http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Aikeydoherty%3Aevolve&package=budgie-desktop)

I'm aware of an [unofficial AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/budgie-desktop-git/), but do not know if it works or is maintained. Feel free to comment if it 
does 🙂

Many features are either missing or not working massively well, but you can now logout, etc, from the desktop and use it. I don't<!--more--> recommend it yet as a 
daily driver due to missing integration with sound, network systems and media keys.

Many thanks go to Matias Linares, who helped at the very last minute last night to get task selection working properly in the new icon tasklist.

To get involved with development, jump over to the [GitHub repository!](https://github.com/solus-project/budgie-desktop)

Feel free to leave comments below, or on G+ as usual.
