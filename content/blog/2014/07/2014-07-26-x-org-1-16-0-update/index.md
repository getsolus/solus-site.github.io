All drivers were updated where possible (newest versions existing) or rebuilt against the new X version. Note that initial vdpau support has been included, 
though vdpau-gl support is yet to be provided, and will be accompanied in the future by a sister firmware installation package.

To update, simply issue the following command:

```
sudo pisi up
```
