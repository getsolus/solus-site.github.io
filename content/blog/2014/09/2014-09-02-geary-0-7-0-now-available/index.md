Geary, a GTK+ email client, is now available for Evolve OS. To install, please run the following command:<!--more-->

```
sudo pisi ur && sudo pisi it geary
```

Please note that not all features may be functional yet due to missing AppIndicator support in Budgie, though you should be able to get by with the Tray Applet right now.
