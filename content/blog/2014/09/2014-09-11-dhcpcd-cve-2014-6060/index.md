All Evolve OS users are advised to update their systems as soon as possible. A vulnerability exists in dhcpcdÂ which allows a denial of service. We have backported the 
relevant fix to our version of dhcpcd to ensure minimal disruption whilst maintaining security,

[A description from the National Vulnerability Database:](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6060)

```
The get_option function in dhcpcd 4.0.0 through 6.x before 6.4.3 allows remote DHCP servers to cause a denial of service by resetting the DHO_OPTIONSOVERLOADED 
option in the (1) bootfile or (2) servername section, which triggers the option to be processed again.
```

To update your system, please issue the following command via the terminal:

```
sudo eopkg upgrade
```

Please note you will need to reboot for the change to take effect, as dhcpcd will be an active process if you are connected to a network.
