Hello all! I hope you're all enjoying the new release of Courageous Budgie! I wanted to take a few minutes to announce a new fundraiser/donations drive initiative 
for the Evolve OS Projects (Distro/Desktop/etc). To cut a short story long, I haven't been able to put as much time as I would have liked into developing Evolve OS and its 
projects over the last couple of months. This is mostly because I have to utilise my spare time to make a little extra income here and there.

Ideally I'd like to give all my spare time over to working on what I love (I'm sure we all would, in reality), but with the help of the community I'm sure we could 
realistically achieve that goal. I'd like to see us have a solid release of Evolve OS and the Budgie Desktop this side of Christmas, at least early-RC stages.

Now, if the "campaign" went well, this frees up the option of being able to invest in a Secure Boot key, for example, on behalf of the project. It will enable me to put all 
the time into perfecting Evolve OS and Budgie, and solidifying the project as a whole.

With more time on the project, I can finish up various things like the overhaul of the installer, driver management, etc on the distro side of things, as well as populating 
the repo at a decent pace. On the Budgie Desktop side of things we can finally begin implementing AppIndicator support, multi-monitor support, better workspaces 
(dynamic), finish the notification center, etc.

So, if you wanna help us out, just click the "Donate" button [on the home page](https://solus-project.com/). There are no obligations, obviously 🙂 If you don't 
want your name published, please say so! If you're ok with it, we'll publish donor names to credit their contribution in a public way. My aim is to put both 
evenings and weekends into Evolve OS and the Budgie Desktop over the coming weeks to really bring the development pace up!
