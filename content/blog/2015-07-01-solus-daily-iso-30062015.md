This is our second daily ISO, which features more hardware support, a slight visual refresh, along with some core bug fixes. This came a few hours late due to some technical issues, an ISO for July 1st will be issued this evening. (Timezones are relative. :])

Main changes:

- UEFI dual-boot issues [resolved](https://git.solus-project.com/packages/os-installer/commit/?h=os-installer-2-16)
- [Issue](https://github.com/solus-project/repository/issues/99) with network hostname change preventing application launches [resolved](https://git.solus-project.com/packages/dhcpcd/commit/?h=dhcpcd-5.6.7-5)
- Updated [firmware](https://git.solus-project.com/packages/linux-firmware/commit/?h=linux-firmware-20150513-4) package, supporting more devices (Intel WiFi, Radeon GPU, Tegra GPU)
- 4.1.1 LTS [kernel](https://git.solus-project.com/packages/kernel/commit/?h=kernel-4.1.1-49)
