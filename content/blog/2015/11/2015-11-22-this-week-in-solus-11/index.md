Welcome to This Week in Solus, Installation #11. 

### Budgie Next

Considerable progress has been around Budgie Next. Lots of work this week was spent with Raven, which now sports the following:

- MPRIS support for media playback support
- Volume changing and input/output device switching and toggling.

Budgie Next also now abides by your primary monitor, which should eliminate issues that multi-monitor users can have of Budgie rendering on your non-primary display when you have a secondary monitor plugged in.
      
Work has also been done to improve multi-panel support and ensuring they render properly with Raven. Below is a video from a few days ago (considerable progress since then).

#### Upcoming Work

Right now work is being done on Drag-and-Drop support. This work will integrated into Budgie's panel for applet moving and in the future, widget moving for Raven.
      
Alongside Drag-and-Drop support, the following will be worked on this week:

1. Adopting a plugin style for Raven like the Budgie panel has.
2. Adding more content for Raven, such as a Weather widget that will tie into libgnome-weather.
3. Porting the remaining applets for Budgie
4. General polishing (such as animations, bug fixes, testing).

We are also planning on rolling out Budgie Next **this week**.
