Welcome to the 14th installation of This Week in Solus.

### Budgie Next

Work has progressed well on the rewrite of Budgie.

- The rewrite is now integrated into GNOME Session and uses its phase initialization system, so Budgie starts in the panel initialization phase and the window manager in the WindowManager phase.
- Information such as whether dark theme is enabled, your widget theme, and icon theme are now integrated into Raven.

Also, work on the panel editor has now begun. A screenshot is available below.

### Multilib

As you may (_or may not, in which case you should really tune in more_) know multilib has been a large item on our path to 1.0. Ikey has been working extensively this week on the multi-stage process for landing 32-bit libraries, and we are happy to report 
that 32-bit enabled GCC is now landing in the repositories.

Before I get into what that means, let's go over the process of getting there:

- **Stage 1**: In the first stage, we cross-compiled a new temporary toolchain to solve the chicken and egg problem: You must have a multilib toolchain to build a multilib toolchain. By cross-compiling a **static*- GCC we defer full GCC (using the system's glibc and headers) to stage 2.
- **Stage 2**: In the second stage, we rebuilt to gain a fully featured toolchain that is used to populate a minimal chroot filesystem to allow barebones functionality in terms of being able to compile simple packages
- **Stage 3**: In the third and final stage, we produced **native*- gcc, glibc, and binutils.

I know, I had to get Ikey to explain it to me too. In fact I ended up just opting to copy and paste what he said.

**The basics**: We cross-compiled a temporary toolchain to compile stuff, to rebuild stuff to use in a minimal chroot filesystem, then produced some native multilib gcc, glibc, and binutils.

These multilib (32-bit enabled) utilities and libraries are going to be the basic for enabling a wider set of applications and another major item that has been a 1.0 requirement, **Steam**.
