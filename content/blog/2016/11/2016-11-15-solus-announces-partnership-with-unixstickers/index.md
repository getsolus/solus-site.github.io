---

The Solus project is happy to announce a partnership with [Unixstickers](https://unixstickers.com), providers of high quality apparel and accessories for operating systems, programming languages, and software. 
This quality craftsmanship and their continuous support of the open source community made it the obvious choice for us while determining the best provider for Solus-related merchandise.

Unixstickers is making available Solus stickers to enable our community and fans to show their passion for Solus on their gadgets and gizmos. When buying from Unixstickers, not only are you getting some 
slick merch, but a [portion of the proceeds is given Solus too](https://www.unixstickers.com/donations/2016/3)! These stickers will be shipping internationally and accessible via 
[both the Unixstickers website](http://www.unixstickers.com/stickers/software_stickers/solus-linux-shaped-sticker) as well as the Store link in the navigation on the page.

We look forward to further working with Unixstickers on broadening the available Solus merchandise for sale and hopefully doing some giveaways in the future!
