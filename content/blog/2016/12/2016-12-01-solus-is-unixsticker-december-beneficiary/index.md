Every time you purchase merchandise from Unixstickers, including [merchandise for Solus](http://www.unixstickers.com/stickers/software_stickers/solus-linux-shaped-sticker), 
a portion of the proceeds goes to the respective project.

Additionally, each month Unixstickers chooses a different project to which they donate an **additional portion** of their total revenue towards. We're grateful that Unixstickers has **chosen Solus** to be December's beneficiary. 
We intend on utilitizing the donations provided by [Unixstickers](https://unixstickers.com)' donation program towards the cost of a **new package server in the United States**, meaning the opportunity for faster 
update speeds and software downloading!

For more details, we'd recommend subscribing to Unixstickers' newsletter!
