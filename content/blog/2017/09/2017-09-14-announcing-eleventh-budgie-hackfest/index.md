The time is nigh to start development of Budgie 11 and you can tune in on Saturday, September 16th at 1700 GMT to watch Ikey work on it live!

Additionally, Bryan will be working on bug crushing and patch landing, and I'll be working on improving our Help Center, specifically improving content layout and discovery.

You can set a reminder via the embedded Youtube event below and chat with us during the stream at `#Solus-Livestream` on `irc.freenode.net` using an IRC client such as Hexchat, Quassel, Weechat, etc.
