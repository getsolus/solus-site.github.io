Welcome to The Roundup #4, your bytes of Solus news. In this roundup, we're talking updates to Kernels, Plasma, various items for Solus 4, and more!

## New Mesalib and Kernels

Today we've [updated our Mesalib to 18.0.0 RC4](https://dev.solus-project.com/R2066:89d15ea723cbe045cf7d780c146e32bf231c864e), which includes a plethora of RADV fixes as well as Intel i965 OpenGL and Vulkan updates.

Additionally, we updated our LTS and stable "current" kernels to [4.9.81](https://dev.solus-project.com/R1966:576ccd1a33a9306dc7587a70725cbd24a042b5cd) and [4.15.3](https://dev.solus-project.com/R3571:52457ef36245301b4497c34aaf4998c200f18700) respectively. On the current kernel front, we've enabled AMDGPU DC support.

## Plasma

Peter has been hard at work continuing to improve the Plasma experience on Solus and issued an ISO earlier this week to [Patrons](https://patreon.com/solus) with a multitude of fixes, such as:

- SDDM integration with Optimus has been fixed with [linux-driver-management 1.0.3](https://github.com/solus-project/linux-driver-management/releases), fixing Xsetup with newer SDDM so we have a correctly initialized environment and that we return the exit code of our helper.
- Missing XDG packages (namely `xdg-utils` and `xdg-user-dirs`) are now present and thus XDG Directories like Pictures are now properly constructed. xdg-user-dirs-update is [now a systemd unit](https://dev.solus-project.com/R3215:d2377272c5723bfa90f00cc2e9d89a07d584d2ae), rather than being XDG Autostart application.
- system-wide locale is [now exported for login](https://dev.solus-project.com/R420:bd9e6735c5ee996cab70490272b3fd43d56f15d9), which should hopefully resolve Plasma locale issues.

Since the issuing of the latest ISO, Peter has updated KDE Frameworks 5 to the latest [5.43.0](https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.43.0.php) release, which introduces fixes and improvements such as:

- Baloo
  - Fix KIO Slave tagged folder deep copies. This breaks listing tagged folders in the tag tree, but is better than broken copies
- Breeze Icons
  - Add emblem-shared colored icon
  - Add missing Krusader icons for folder sync
  - Make weather-fog day/night neutral
  - Update Dropbox systemtray icon theme
- KCompletion
  - Fix incorrect emission of textEdited() by KLineEdit
- KConfig
  - Use `Ctrl+Shift+`, as the standard shortcut for "Configure <Program>"
- KIO
  - Allow to filter places based on alternative application name
  - Improved error handling in file ioslave
  - Multiple performance improvements
  - Repair copying file to VFAT without warnings
- KNotification
  - The "Run Command" notification action has been fixed
- Plasma Framework
  - Default tooltip: Fix sizing
  - Fix RTL appearance for ComboBox
  - Plasma Dialog: Call window effects only if visible

## Solus 4

snapd integration for Solus 4 has been deferred to unblock the Solus 4 release. We will instead land the relevant integration in a future update to the Software Center as and when some pending feature-work has been fully integrated upstream.

The Software Center for Solus 4 will still introduce a fresh design and integrate all the work we've done [in Linux Driver Management](/2018/01/26/linux-driver-management-1-0-released) to provide an improved hardware support and driver installation experience. This Software Center will also utilize the plugin-based architecture that Ikey had worked on during his time at Ubuntu Rally last September, and this will simplify the process of implementing and enabling snapd integration in a future update.

So aside from the Software Center, what further items do we have for the release of Solus 4?

1. Enabling Hotspot support with `hostapd`
2. Budgie 10.4.1 Release
3. Brisk Menu Release
4. UI refreshing for our default MATE experience
5. Enabling an **experimental** Wayland session for GNOME. Wayland **will not** be the default for Solus Budgie or Solus GNOME, however GNOME users will be able to install a separate session package if they wish to test and experiment with Wayland support. During my testing, I have not found the quality of the GNOME + Wayland to be sufficient enough to be provided as a default experience for our users, and I largely concur with [Canonical's reasoning for deferring it as a default for Ubuntu as well](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2018/01/26/bionic-beaver-18-04-lts-to-use-xorg-by-default/).
