We are really excited to be introducing our new community forums. With the introduction of our Flarum-based community forums, we will have a new centerpiece to community engagement that provides us with the user experience and flexibility we've long desired.
<!--more-->

With Flarum, we've been able to:

- Introduce a better support medium with functionality like Best Answers to highlight the best answer from the Team or the Community.
- Enable a more personalized user experience by having custom social media badges on your profiles and **user-enabled dark mode**.
- Enable multiple login methods so you don't need **yet another account**. Our support login methods include our **Development Tracker**, GitHub, and traditional username / email + password.
- Enable two-factor authentication, which supports any authentication application that supports TOTP.

Flarum also provides us some fancy things like:

- More flexibility in how we organize our discussions, with support for primary and secondary tags.
- Availability of user-created extensions for media embedding, custom reactions, discussion necrobump warnings, and more.

Flarum enables us to follow through with our commitment to [improving community engagement](/2018/10/11/improving-community-engagement/) and providing a new avenue for people to:

1. Provide feedback on documentation, our website, and more.
2. Report issues ranging from packaging to hardware issues, that can be further escalated to Phabricator if necessary.
3. Engage with other community members, showcase their artworks / wallpapers, etc.
4. Engage with the Team on announcements, whether that's coming from our cross-posted blog posts or future Activity Hub-based.

So check it out and start engaging at [https://discuss.getsol.us](https://discuss.getsol.us). We would love to hear your feedback [here](https://discuss.getsol.us/d/1-introducing-our-new-community-forums).
