## Budgie

{{< altimg "Budgie.jpg" "/release-images/4.4/" >}}

Solus ships with the latest 10.7 series release of the Budgie Desktop environment, [10.7.2](https://blog.buddiesofbudgie.org/budgie-10-7-2/). This features GNOME 43 stack support alongside all the fixes and quality-of-life improvements listed below. We welcome you to check out the full release notes from Buddies of Budgie listed above.

The Budgie edition of Solus now ships with the Nemo file manager by default instead of Nautilus. We decided to make this change as, since our last release, Nautilus has been ported to GTK4 and libadwaita. Because of this, it no longer fits in with the look and feel of the rest of the desktop environment. Additionally, a few features that people relied on were removed without replacement, prompting the desire to find a familiar and feature-rich file manager alternative.

### Bug Fixes and Cleanup

- No longer reload the Budgie Menu during a AppIndex change when the menu is open
- Fix large fonts pushing the close button out of notification popups
- Notification pop-ups will no longer steal focus
- Notifications should no longer cause screen flickering when in a full-screen application

### Quality-of-life Improvements

- New widget API for Raven
- New application indexer for Budgie Menu and Run Dialog
- New power dialog for session management
- Dual-GPU support in Budgie Menu when launching applications
- Quick XDG directory access in Budgie Menu
- Buttons for settings added to Budgie Menu
- New Budgie Screenshot application
- Notifications will now fade in and out upon showing and closing
- When a window leaves full screen mode, Budgie will now show a notification popup to alert the user that there are notifications that they didn't see
- Notification sounds are now supported
- The Media Player widget now has a more compact design
- You can now click on the widget header icons for sound output and input to mute the respective device
- New usage monitor widget for Raven

## MATE

{{< altimg "MATE.jpg" "/release-images/4.4/" >}}

Solus 4.4 MATE Edition ships with the latest MATE 1.27 series release, 1.27.1.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Planned deprecation of the MATE Edition üò±

As we implement our strategy for 4.5, including the adoption of PipeWire and Wayland where feasible, we have been evaluating the current state of the desktop landscape. In particular, we have looked at how various projects have implemented these solutions. In doing so, it has become clear that Wayland has continued to mature as more projects work to phase out X.Org support and collaborate on modern solutions for important aspects of the desktop experience. These include: Color Management, High Dynamic Range (HDR), and Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support.

After evaluating MATE, we have concluded that it does not have a credible and active Wayland strategy, with the project itself effectively being on life support. As such, we have decided to sunset the MATE Edition. Hence, Solus 4.4 will be the last release to ship a MATE edition ISO. For the time being, we will continue to support the actual MATE packages in order to ensure that our users will be able to update their existing MATE installations.

**Going forward, to serve users looking for a simple, lightweight GTK-based desktop experience, we will instead ship an edition with Xfce in the near future.** Xfce sees considerably more development than MATE and has a viable Wayland strategy. Work on building out the Xfce stack has already started and will begin landing in the unstable repo shortly after the 4.4 release.

The reality is that, at some point in the not-too-distant future, we will need to deprecate and remove the MATE packages from Solus. We would like to stress, however, that we are working to provide a seamless upgrade path from MATE to Xfce for those users with an existing MATE installation. You can expect to see more information on this topic soon.

### Defaults Changes

- Changed the default GTK theme to Qogir-Dark.

### Bug Fixes and Cleanup

- The MATE 1.27 series upstream changes include reliability and accessibility fixes plus small bug fixes and translation updates.
- The Solus MATE edition now uses `xorg-driver-input-libinput` instead `xorg-driver-input-evdev` to make keyboard layouts other than en_US actually work in Xorg in both the greeter and the MATE desktop session.
- Added qxl video driver by default to bring the MATE edition to parity with our other editions re. virtualization video driver support.
