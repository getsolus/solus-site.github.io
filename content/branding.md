## Names

**Solus Project** is the organization that develops and distributes the operating system, as well as associated programs and tooling.

The word **Solus** refers to the Linux operating system distribution developed by the Solus Project. This name should not be used in conjunction with other acronyms or terminology, such as, but not limited to, "Solus OS", "Solus Operating System", and "Solus Linux".

## Markings

The Solus Project has two marks: a circular icon, and a circular icon with the Solus name next to it. Both represent Solus and the Solus Project.

When using these logos, try to keep the following in mind:

- Do not stretch, skew, rotate, flip, or otherwise alter the marks.
- Try not to use the marks with a busy background.

{{< figure
  src="/imgs/Solus.svg"
  alt="Solus logo"
  caption="Default logo"
  width=125
  class="my-8"
>}}

The logo with text can be used when space allows to refer to the Solus Project, or the Solus distribution.

When using the textual logo, keep these things in mind:

- Don't try to recreate the logo using a specific font; just use the provided logo.
- Don't use the logo at small sizes; use the logo without text if the text becomes hard to read.
